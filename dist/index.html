        So you want to be a millionaire? That may seem impossible, but based on Grow calculations, that’s how much most 25-year-olds today may need to retire comfortably. If you haven’t already begun saving and investing, the time to start working toward that goal is now. Luckily, the sooner you begin, the easier it is to build wealth for the future.
    </p>
    <p class="body-text">
        We’ve put together a tool that can help you estimate how much you’ll need and can help you get started on a plan.
    </p>
    <p class="body-text">
        Follow along and enter your information below to get a personalized savings goal. 
    </p>
    <h2>Basic information</h2>
    <p class="body-text">
        To begin, we need to know how old you are now and at what age you plan to retire, so we can calculate how long you’ll have to save. 
    </p>
    <div class="calc-input">
        <label for="current-age">Current age</label>
        <input type="number" name="current-age" v-model.number="currentAge"></input>
    </div>
    <p class="body-text">
        While the current average retirement age among retirees is <a href="https://dqydj.com/average-retirement-age-in-the-united-states/">about 60 years old</a>, that’s expected to increase for younger generations. Americans born in 1960 or later can access partial Social Security benefits at age 62 and full benefits at age 67. Some experts recommend <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/01/30/suze-orman-and-stanford-research-agree-70-is-the-new-retirement-age.html">holding off on collecting until age 70</a> because Americans are living longer, meaning your savings need to last longer.
    </p>
    <p class="body-text">
        If you’re not sure what to choose, consider going with the default age of 67.

        Over time you should see an average annual growth of 5-10%, not counting inflation. <a href="https://www.moneyunder30.com/rate-of-return-for-retirement-planning">Some experts advise</a> you to use a conservative estimate of 5-6% since it’s better to end up with too much money than too little. Others say you can safely use 8%, which has been <a href="http://www.moneychimp.com/features/market_cagr.htm">roughly the compound annual growth rate of the S&P 500 since 1980</a>.

    <h2>How much you need</h2>
    <p class="body-text">
        Now comes the tricky part: figuring out how much you'll need to save to live comfortably in retirement. <a href="https://grow.acorns.com/how-to-find-out-how-much-money-you-need-to-retire-comfortably/">Generally, experts say</a> you'll need 70 to 80% of your income each year to maintain your standard of living, but that isn't the case for everyone.
    </p>
    <p class="body-text">
        Lifestyle factors and preferences will affect how much you spend during your retirement. If you're hoping to live a more active lifestyle and travel often, you should <a href="https://www.fidelity.com/viewpoints/retirement/spending-in-retirement">add six percentage points</a> to your annual budget.
    </p>
    <p class="body-text">
        We'll start you off with an annual spending goal of 75% of your final income. You can make adjustments based on the expectations you have for your post-work years.
